## Naming: 
Choose a descriptive name for the function that indicates its purpose.

## Parameters:
 Functions can accept parameters, which act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function.

## Return Statement: 
The return statement specifies the value that will be returned by the function. If omitted, the function will return undefined by default.

## Scope:
 Variables defined within a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

## Hoisting:
 Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope, meaning they can be called before they are defined. Function expressions and arrow functions are not hoisted.

## Asynchronous Function
 setTimeout and setInterval are part of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, used for scheduling code execution.
setTimeout: Executes a function once after a specified delay.
setInterval: Repeatedly executes a function with a fixed time delay between each call.
Both functions are non-blocking and leverage the event loop to handle timed operations.
